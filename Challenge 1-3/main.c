Electricity consumption (in kWh)
User type (1 for residential, 2 for commercial)
Contract type (0 for standard, 1 for reduced)
The rates are:

Residential: €0.20/kWh for standard contract, €0.15/kWh for reduced contract
Commercial: €0.30/kWh for standard contract, €0.25/kWh for reduced contract
Add a 10% surcharge if consumption exceeds 500 kWh.
